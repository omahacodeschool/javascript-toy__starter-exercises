  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
    <h3> What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like `"I am 9 years old"`? How about `"9 is my age"`? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly? </h3>
    <p>To be parsed correctly (at least the way we're doing it), the first character in the string has to be an integer. Otherwise all you get is "NaN"</p>

    <h3> What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you? </h3> 
    <p>Honestly, I didn't get any errors. If I didn't set my input to a number, javascript just gave that variable a default value of "NaN - "not a number" if the input wasn't something that could be parsed 
    into an integer OR tried to set its value used a variable with a NaN value in the equation.  </p>

    <h3> What questions do you have? </h3>
    <p>No questions -- but the incrementing was sneaky. I thought I was done until I realized that it changed the original value of the variable I was running the function on.</p>
