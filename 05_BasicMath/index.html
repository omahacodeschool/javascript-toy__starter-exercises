  <h1>JS Atomic 05 - Basic Math</h1>
  <h2>What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "I am 9 years old"? How about "9 is my age"? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
  <p>It appears that you can parse an integer out of a string as long as that integer is the first character.</p>

  <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
  <p>For all the variables that don't have an integer value javascript returns NaN. All of the arithmatic that happens to use a NaN variable also returns NaN.</p>
