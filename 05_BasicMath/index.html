  <h1>JS Atomic 05</h1>

<h3>
- What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like `"I am 9 years old"`? How about `"9 is my age"`? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?
</h3>
<p>
When I tried to parse out an integer in a sentence, this happened :I am 8 + 10 + 10 = NaN.
String has to be converted into an integer that it can understand before it can be parsed correctly.
</p>
<h3>
- What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?
</h3>
If this happens I get this error, $ - 10 - 5 = NaN, and at least for me the console is blank.
<h3>
- What questions do you have?
I saw the use of the parseInt on stackoverflow but I wasn't quite understanding it so I took the longer route seen in global.js. I looked at the solution once I finished my own route and it makes sense that way. I left my file with the route I took.
