    What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like `"I am 9 years old"`? How about `"9 is my age"`? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?
  </h2>
  <p>
    In the example of "I am 9 years old", the parseInt() function would return NaN. However, in the case of "9 is my age", we would actually be able to get the number 9 to return. This is because the way parseInt() is set up. If the the first character of the string is not able to be converted into a number, the function returns NaN (not a number). Since "9 is my age" begins with a number, the function would convert "9" into a number.

  <h2>
    What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?
  </h2>
  <p>
    When I tested this by typing in "%" and "," for two of my inputs, the console log returned "NaN" for both of them. 
  </p>
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>I'm curious as to know how to use the optional second that parseInt() can accept. I breifly read about it, but it didn't make a whole lot of sense when I read it.
