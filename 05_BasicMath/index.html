  <h1>JS Atomic 05</h1>

		<h2>What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "I am 9 years old"? How about "9 is my age"? Other combinations of numbers and letters?</h2>
		<p>i think it'll only work on that second example. the number has to be first.</p>

		<h2>What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
		<p>it has to start with a radix or a number</p>

		<h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
		<p> NaN</p>

		<h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
		<p>just go over this in class. reading long explanations isn't helpful</p>
