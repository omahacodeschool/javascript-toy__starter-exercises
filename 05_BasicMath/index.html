  <h1>JS Atomic 05</h1>
<h2>What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like `"I am 9 years old"`? How about `"9 is my age"`? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
<p>When you try the first option, "I am 9 years old.", it respons with NaN, meaning "not a number".  The second example it correctly identifies that 9 is a number and returns that.  From this, it would seem that where the number is in the string is important for whether or not the number is parsed correctly.  Which is to say, if the number's right up front, it'll work.</p>

<h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
<p>When I tried it with the string "1,2,$3" it gave me back 1.  It didn't give me an error, or at least if it did, I didn't know where to find it other than the console.  So, from this, one might surmise that when faced with a non-numeric character, it stops proceeding through the string and returns whatever it's found so far.  This tracks for what we saw with the earlier example of "9 is my age" which returned 9 whereas the other example "I am 9 years old" returned NaN.</p>
