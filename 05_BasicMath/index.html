  <h1>Questions:</h1>
<p>
What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like `"I am 9 years old"`? How about `"9 is my age"`? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?
</p>
<p>
It must be free of other characters like letters. I used `.replace` to eliminate unwanted characters before converting the numeric strings to Integers.
</p>
<p>
- What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?
</p>
<p>
The result is `NaN` ("Not A Number"). Every math operation that contains a `NaN` results in a `NaN` answer.
