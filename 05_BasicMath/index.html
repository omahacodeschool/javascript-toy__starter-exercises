  <h1>JS Atomic 05: Check console for output!</h1>

  <h2>What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "I am 9 years old"? How about "9 is my age"? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
  <p>Trying to parse the integer from "I am 9 years old" didn't work. However, in the second example, js was able to parse 9 out of the string. I'm guessing that this is because an integer was the first character in the string.</p>

  <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
  <p>In computations that involve whichever variable isn't stored as an integer, the console returns the 'NotANumber' error.</p>

  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>This isn't exactly a question, but for some reason in surprised me that when I ran increment/decrement a variable, it saved the changed value as the variable. I expected it to be more like "This is the value of your variable plus one, but we're not changing the actual value of your variable".</p>
