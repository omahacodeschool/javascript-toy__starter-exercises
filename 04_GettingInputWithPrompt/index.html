  <h1>JS Atomic 04</h1>
   <h3>1. What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use `typeof` and `console.log()` to help with this.</h3>
   <p>The data type of the information that is coming in for me is a string.</p>

<h3>2. What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h3>
<p>The variable remains blank, it doesnt have a value assigned to it, however, the variables are defined, and are not nil, in point of fact the 'typeof' command registers the variable value as a string.</p>

<h3>3. How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h3>
<p>I chose the variable name that closely resembles the information that it represents.  I think it would be pretty easy for some one to read my variable names and determine what they represent.</p>

<h3>4. If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h3>
<p>Changing the question being asked of a user would warrant a change of variable name, however I dont believe the order in which the questions are asked would or should.</p>

<h3>5. In these exercises, we use `prompt()` to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use `prompt()` -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with `prompt()`? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use `prompt()`?</h3>
<p>HTML forms are normally used to get information from a user.  With a form, the information has an opportunity to be retrieved by the controller and thus stored in a variety of different places for a longer duration.  Prompt is a very easy way of interacting with the users however, and if I was looking to get trivial information that could affect an individual website experience, I would use it.</p>

<h3>6. Research `prompt()` -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h3>
<p>Aparently the only way to do this is to create a 'custom module' that would mimick the javascript 'prompt' to do so.</p>

<h3>7. What questions do you have?</h3>
<p>None at this time.</p>
