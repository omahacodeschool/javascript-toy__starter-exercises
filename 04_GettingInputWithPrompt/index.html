  <h1>JS Atomic 04</h1>

	  <h2>What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
	  <p> alerts turn everything into string objects. console.log leaves their tyepe as-is. </p>

		<h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
		<p> No info gets assigned </p>
		
		<h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2>
		<p>By what makes sense. yes.</p>

		<h2>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h2>
		<p>Yes. no.</p>

		<h2>In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?</h2>
		<p>Forms. That way it's easier to store it in a database. No disadvantages. Prompt if you want to use the input immediately and it doesn't need to be saved.</p>

		<h2>Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h2>
		<p> If you use a jquery ui framework </p>

		<h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
		<p> none </p>
