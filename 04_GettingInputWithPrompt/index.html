  <h1>JS Atomic 04</h1>

  <h2>What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
  <p>From what I have gathered from the 'debug' tab in the console, the prompts return strings, even when the user inputs a number.</p>

  <h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
  <p>If the user clicks submits an empty prompt, an empty string is returned and assigned to the variable.</p>

  <h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2>
  <p>I tried to keep my variable names close to what the variable is assigned. They are a bit short, so being a bit more descriptive would be helpful.</p>

  <h2>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h2>
  <p>I suppose renaming the variable would make sense if changing the question changes the type of information that would be returned. Changing the order of the questions shouldn't matter as long as you are referring to the variables in the correct manner.</p>

  <h2>In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?</h2>
  <p>Typically, information is gathered from users in HTML forms. An advantage of using forms is that the user isn't bombarded with a pop-up prompt. Pop-ups being the scourge of the Internet, many users might just exit them without reading the prompt. A prompt might be useful when really trying to get the user's attention instead of just filling out typical form information.</p>

  <h2>Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h2>
  <p>From my research it appears that the humble 'prompt()' isn't allowed to have multiple inputs thanks to the browsers. However, there appear to be some workarounds to bypass this using jQuery. This is out of my grasp at the moment though.</p>

  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>At the moment I don't have any questions. Maybe I'm just a bit slow on the uptake and I'm not thinking ahead...</p>
