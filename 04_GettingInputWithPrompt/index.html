  <h1>Questions:</h1>
<p>
1. What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use `typeof` and `console.log()` to help with this.
</p>
<p>
The number is converted to a string.
</p>
<p>
2. What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?
</p>
<p>
It appears to be an empty string, according to the console.
</p>
<p>
3. How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?
</p>
<p>
I camelCased my variables, and was specific eg: userHomeTown, userAge. Yes, I feel that any literate person could extract an accurate summary of the info contained within.
</p>
<p>
4. If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?
</p>
<p>
Yes, in this case, it would make sense to rename the variable after changing the question. The order would not matter in this case.
</p>
<p>
5. In these exercises, we use `prompt()` to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use `prompt()` -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with `prompt()`? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use `prompt()`?
</p>
<p>
Typically, when filling out information like hair color and age, one would use an html form. A prompt demands immediate attention, and so could be used to enter a password to login, or to confirm a submission, purchase, or the like. 
</p>
<p>
6. Research `prompt()` -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?
</p>
<p>
From what I've found, it is not possible without something like jQueryUI(?).
</p>
<p>
7. What questions do you have? 
</p>
<p>
I would like to know about Question #6. Is this true?
