  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
  <h2> What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
  <p>It converts the data-type to strings. </p>
  
  <h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything  in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
  <p>The prompts still occur but nothing gets assigned to the variables.</p>
  
  <h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2>

  <p>I assigned var names that describe the vars themselves. Yes.</p>

  <h2>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h2>
  <p>It depends on the nature of the question before and after. If you change the order of your questions changes the order</p>

  <h2>In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?</h2>
  <p>Most websites use cookies to store user information. You might use a prompt for a "Are you sure you want to perform this action?" scenario. </p>
  

  <h2>Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h2>
  <p>No</p>
