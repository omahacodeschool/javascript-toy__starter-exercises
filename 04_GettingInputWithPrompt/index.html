  <h1>JS Atomic 04</h1>

  <h2>
    What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use <code>typeof</code> and <code>console.log()</code> to help with this.
  </h2>

  <p>
    The input information is always stored as a string.
  </p>

  <h2>
    What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?
  </h2>

  <p>
    When submitting an empty <code>prompt()</code> everything still works properly, however, the variable remains undefined.   
  </p>

  <h2>
    How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?
  </h2>

  <p>
    I chose my variable names based on the information I was storing in them. I believe someone who hasn't seen my code could reasonably predict the information I might store in each.
  </p>

  <h2>
    If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?
  </h2>

  <p>
    I believe it would make sense to totally rename the variable if you completely changed the question you were asking the user. If named appropriately, I don't believe the order of the questions should have any bearing on the variable names.
  </p>

  <h2>
    In these exercises, we use <code>prompt()</code> to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use <code>prompt()</code> -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with <code>prompt()</code>? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use <code>prompt()</code>?
  </h2>

  <p>
    Most websites collect user information through forms or by storing specific data in the form of cookies. The advantages to doing it that way is that the process is more streamlined and provides a better user experience. I cannot readily think of any disadvantages of this process. A situation where <code>prompt</code> might come in handy is again when you want to display a message to the user before they input their information. 
  </p>

  <h2>
    Research <code>prompt()</code> -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?
  </h2>

  <p>
    From my very minimal research it does not appear that it is possible to make it so that there are two or more fields for the <code>prompt()</code> command without using other languages.
  </p>

  <h2>
    What questions do you have?
  </h2>

  <p>
    What do you believe would be some disadvantages to using forms as opposed to <code>prompt()</code> and what would you determine as a good situation to use <code>prompt()</code>
