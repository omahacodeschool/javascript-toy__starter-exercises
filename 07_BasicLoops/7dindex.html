<i>Why don't we just answer these questions here</i>
<h2>Apart from changing your loop headers, what other changes do you need to make for each? Given that you use either loop structure interchangeably, what do the different loop structures seem suited for?</h2>
<p>There were very few changes I had to make--I finished converting them in just a few minutes. I feel like I could refactor more but I didn't want to break anything. I might play around with that more tomorrow.</p>
<p>As for when to use each, if they truly are interchangeable, it seems to be preference and good practices. I like for loops because they're more elegant, but I think if my end conditions were more complicated than simply counting down, I might switch to "while"</p>
