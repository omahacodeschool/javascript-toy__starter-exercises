  <h1>JS Atomic 06d - Driver's ed part 1</h1>
  <h2>Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h2>
  <p>Doesn't look like it.</p>
  <h2>What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?</h2>
  <p>Age cannot be both less than 16 and greater than 21, thats silly.</p>
  <h2>Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h2>
  <p>I guess you would make variables set to age limits in each location and then you would have to compare the user's age against those variables. But you would also need a way to swap out those variables based on the location that the user accessed the site from. That seems messy.</p>
