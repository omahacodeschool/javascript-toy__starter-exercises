  <h1>JS Atomic 06</h1>
<h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
<p>It needs to match exactly.</p>

<h2>Did you use `=` or `==` or `===` to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h2>
<p>I used '===' because out of the three that one is probably best suited to establishing equality, though '==' would also have worked.  '=' would just have reset the variable to something else.</p>

<h2>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h2>
<p>Though I imagine that "duh" would probably suffice as an answer for this, generally speaking, you don't want to put something sensitive like a password in a place that's accessible to people who shouldn't have it.  Putting it in plaintext does just that.  </p>
