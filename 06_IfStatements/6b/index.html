  <h1>Questions:</h1>
<p>
- Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?
</p>
<p>
No, there is no flexibilty.
<p>
- Did you use `=` or `==` or `===` to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?
</p>
I used `===` to compare them, and I suppose `==` would work fine. `=` would not work, as it is not a comparison.
<p>
- Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?
</p>
It will be visible to everyone. Not a great idea.
