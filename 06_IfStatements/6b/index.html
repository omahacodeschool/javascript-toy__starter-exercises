  <h1>JS Atomic 06b - Basic Math</h1>
  <h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
  <p>Looks like password needs to be exact even if you use == operator.</p>

  <h2>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work</h2>
  <p>I did not use = that would have just set on variable to the other.f I used == but it seems that at least for this implementation == and === would be interchangable.</p>

  <h2>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h2>
  <p>I can view the console log or the source code and no I have that users passwords.</p>
