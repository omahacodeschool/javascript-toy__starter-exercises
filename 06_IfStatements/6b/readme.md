## 6B: Password Game

In your Javascript file, hardcode a password (e.g. `var password = "monkeybrains";` but pick your own password) Prompt the user for a password; if it matches your stored password, give them an `alert()` that says "Good job!" If it doesn't match, give them an `alert()` that says something to the effect of `"Sorry, the password is actually monkeybrains."` Make sure to use the variable storing the password instead of the string-literal that represents the password text so your program can easily change.

### Questions

- Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?
- Did you use `=` or `==` or `===` to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?
- Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?
