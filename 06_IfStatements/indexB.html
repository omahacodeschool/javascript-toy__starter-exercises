  <h1>JS Atomic 06B</h1>

  <h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
  <p>When I changed the inputted password from bubblegumpopprincess to BUBBLEgumpopprincess, I was told it was incorrect.</p>

  <h2>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h2>
  <p>I used ==. As far as I can tell, = isn't used in JS to compare anything--it's merely for setting something equal to something else. I didn't user === because it seems a lot pickier than ==; ej. differentiating between strings and integers in which both appear as numbers.</p>

  <h2>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h2>
  <p>If that file were compromised, it'd be available to the whole world. Encryption is always a good idea with sensitive information.</p>
