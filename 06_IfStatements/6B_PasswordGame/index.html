  <h2>
    Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?
  </h2>

  <p>
    With my implementationm the user-provided password must match my password exactly.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Did you use <code>=</code> or <code>==</code> or <code>===</code> to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?
  </h2>

  <p>
    I used <code>===</code> in order to compare passwords. I used this because I read that <code>===</code> does not attempt to perform any conversion unlike <code>==</code>. I believe that <code>==</code> would work, however, it may allow for small variations in the password which for all intents and purposes wouldn't be the best idea. I don't believe <code>=</code> would work at all because you would then be assigning the user input to you password which creates all sorts of issues. Not only would it always evaluate as <code>true</code>, but your password would also be at the mercy of your user being changed every time the program was run.

  <h2>
    Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?
  </h2>

  <p>
    I would assume it's generally a bad idea since it would be easily accessible to anyone, especially in the event someone with malicious intent.
