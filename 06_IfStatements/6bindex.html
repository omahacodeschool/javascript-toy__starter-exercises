  <h1>JS Atomic 06.B Passwords</h1>

  <h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization? Did you use `=` or `==` or `===` to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work? Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h2>
  <p>My password is case-sensitive, although I bet there are ways to work around that. I used === but tested with == and it seemed to work just as well. You can't use just = because that resets the password and will accept literally anything.</p>
  <p>Sumeet said Javascript is also PUBLIC, so if a sensitive password were stored in Javascript, someone could just view the page source and have access to that information.</p>
