  <h1>JS Atomic 06-F</h1>

  <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h2>
  <p><b>Prediction:</b> I suppose it will just say it's not a valid triangle. <b>Actual:</b> It sends the alert that "these lengths don't form a real triangle." I didn't account for NaN inputs.</p>

  <h2>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h2>
  <p><b>Prediction:</b> I suppose it will just say it's not a valid triangle, like the last issue. <b>Actual:</b> Yep.</p>

  <h2>What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h2>
  <p><b>Prediction:</b> Same, I suppose? <b>Actual:</b> Yeah.</p>
