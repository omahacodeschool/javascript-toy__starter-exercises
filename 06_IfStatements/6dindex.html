  <h2>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h2>
  <p>The messages display in the order of the if-statements, but I moved them around and didn't have any problems with them returning anything unexpected. (I moved the "don't drink and drive" one to the bottom since I think it made a nicer "goodbye" sort of statement)</p>

- Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?
- When testing ranges, did you use `&&`, `||`, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used `&&`, why is that a better choice than `||` (and vice-versa)?
- What types of input produce a value of `NaN` after parsing? Is it important to check for `NaN` values? Is it possible for a `NaN` value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?
- What questions do you have?
