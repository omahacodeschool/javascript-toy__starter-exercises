  <h1>JS Atomic 06E</h1>

  <h2>Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h2>
  <p>If you only intend on the input to be caught by one if statement, it shouldn't make a difference what order the statements are in. My program still worked when I reordered two of the statements.</p>

  <h2>What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?</h2>
  <p>An integer can not be both less than 16 and greater than 21.</p>

  <h2>Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h2>
  <p>It matters if it'll actually be of use to easily change the legal driving, drinking, etc. ages. It doesn't seem like it'd be that difficult to do. Simply prompt the user for these legal ages in his/her country and then store those numbers to variables against which to compare the user's age.</p>
