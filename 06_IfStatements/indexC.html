  <h1>JS Atomic 06C</h1>

  <h2>If you collect the user's input as a string (i.e. without using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), does == work to compare the input to the stored secret number? Would === work? Which is best?</h2>
  <p>== does work. === does not. I prefer == because it doesn't require any sort of conversion.</p>

  <h2>If you collect the user's input as an integer (i.e. by using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), can you use == to compare? ===? Which is better in this case?</h2>
  <p>It seemed to work in both situations. In this case, I don't really know if one is better than the other--I still prefer the == option because then there is no need to convert at all.</p>

  <h2>What is the difference between == and ===?</h2>
  <p>As far as I've been able to deduce, while both are comparison operators, == leaves some leeway as far as data type, while === is stricter.</p>

  <h2>In this case, does it make more sense to leave the user's guess as a string, or to convert it to an integer? Why? What are the relative advantages / disadvantages of each approach (particularly in terms of the types of new features that might be able to be added)?</h2>
  <p>Maybe there are factors I don't know about yet, but as of now I'd choose the option that doesn't require the conversion--not only because that's an extra line of code with extra opportunity for a bug, but also because lots of users probably want to set password that include both letters and numbers.</p>
