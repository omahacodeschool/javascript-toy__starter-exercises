  <h1>JS Atomic 06</h1>

<h2>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h2>

<h2>When testing ranges, did you use `&&`, `||`, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used `&&`, why is that a better choice than `||` (and vice-versa)?</h2>

<h2>What types of input produce a value of `NaN` after parsing? Is it important to check for `NaN` values? Is it possible for a `NaN` value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?</h2>

<h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
