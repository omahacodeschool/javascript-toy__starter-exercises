  <h2>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h2>
  <p>The order does determine what order the alerts will be displayed, in cases of an input triggering multiple alerts.</p>

  <h2>When testing ranges, did you use &&, ||, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used &&, why is that a better choice than || (and vice-versa)?</h2>
  <p>I used &&. Frankly, I'm not quite sure how you'd effectively use ||. It seems like only one half of the if statement would work, if that makes sense.</p>

  <h2>What types of input produce a value of NaN after parsing? Is it important to check for NaN values? Is it possible for a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?</h2>
  <p>Letters and symbols, I guess? Anything that's not a number. I don't believe a NaN value could trigger any of the other if statments because they're all based on numbers. I think it's important to check for NaN values inasmuch as you wouldn't want to <i>not</i> provide some sort of feedback for an unusable input.</p>

  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>I'd like to hear more about if/how || would work for these sorts of if statements. Maybe I'm not thinking about it the right way. I'd also like to know that my understanding of NaN values are correct.</p>
