## 6A: Relational and Equality Operators

No if-statements yet. Instead, we'll do some exploration of the relational and equality operators so you can see them at work. Use the console (and `console.log()`) to work your way through these statements by typing them exactly as you see them into your Javascript file. Before you run the code, predict the output of each statement (like I've done the first one for you).

(Note that some of the below examples use a double-equals `==` and some use a triple-equals `===`.)

- `console.log( "5 == '5' is " + (5 == '5') ); // true`
- `console.log( "5 == 'five' is " + (5 == 'five') );`
- `console.log( "5 == '6' is " + (5 == '6') );`
- `console.log( "5 === '5' is " + (5 === '5') );`
- `console.log( "5 == 2 + 3 is " + (5 == 2 + 3) );`
- `console.log( "5 == 5 is " + (5 == 5) );`
- `console.log( "5 === 5 is " + (5 === 5) );`
- `console.log( "true == 'true' is " + (true == 'true') );`
- `console.log( "true === 'true' is " + (true === 'true') );`
- `console.log( "true == false is " + (true == false) );`
- `console.log( "5 == 12 is " + (5 == 12) );`
- `console.log( "5 != 12 is " + (5 != 12) );`
- `console.log( "5 < 12 is " + (5 < 12) );`
- `console.log( "5 <= 12 is " + (5 <= 12) );`
- `console.log( "5 > 12 is " + (5 > 12));`
- `console.log( "5 >= 12 is " + (5 >= 12));`

In your HTML document, record your answers (organized by statements) and explain what the operator does. You'll want to record your guess, whether your guess was right or wrong, and, if it was wrong, why.

### Questions

- What do you call `true` and `false` values?
- How is `true` similar or dissimilar from `"true"`? Can they be used in the same way?
