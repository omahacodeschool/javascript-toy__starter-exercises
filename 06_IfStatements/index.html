  <h1>JS Atomic 06</h1>
  <h3>What do you call true and false values?</h3>
  
  <p>Booleans</p>

  <h3>How is true similar or dissimilar from "true"? Can they be used in the same way?</h3>
  
  <p>"true" acts as a string</p>

  <h3>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h3>
   <p>Must be exact</p>
  <h3>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h3>

  <p>When comparing to see if two things are equal you can use the "==" "===" operators. "==" compares equal "===" is strict equal: Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type </p>

  <h3>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h3>
  <p>Cause that information exisits on the client end and thus wouldn't secure</p>

  <h3>If you collect the user's input as a string (i.e. without using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), does == work to compare the input to the stored secret number? Would === work? Which is best?</h3>
  <p>In this case only == will work.The strict equal will only work if the are both things are the same type. The input values of the prompt box is a string.</p>

  <h3>If you collect the user's input as an integer (i.e. by using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), can you use == to compare? ===? Which is better in this case?</h3>
  <p>Yes. I'd say it was better to us === operator.</p>

  <h3>What is the difference between == and ===?</h3>
  <p> Answer above</p>

  <h3>In this case, does it make more sense to leave the user's guess as a string, or to convert it to an integer? Why? What are the relative advantages / disadvantages of each approach (particularly in terms of the types of new features that might be able to be added)?</h3>
  <p>I'd say using the "===" because it seems like it would be more fool proof as the program grew.</p>

  <h3>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h3>
  <p>Yes. The program goes from top to bottom through the code</p>

  <h3>When testing ranges, did you use &&, ||, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used &&, why is that a better choice than || (and vice-versa)?</h3>
  <p>I didn't use either. I just used >= and <= .</p>

  <h3>What types of input produce a value of NaN after parsing? Is it important to check for NaN values? Is it possible for a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?</h3>
  <p></p>
  
  <h3>Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h3>
  <p>The conditional still works.</p>
  
  <h3>What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?</h3>
  
  <h3>Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h3>
  <p> Seems better to store the valid age range in a variable like "validDriver" or "validDrinker" and then country by country you could set the varabile to what is appropriate  </p>

  <h3>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h3>
  <p>Prediction: Get a non vaild triangle error</p>

  <h3>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h3>
  <p>Prediction: Get a non vaild triangle error</p>

  <h3>What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h3>
  <p>Prediction: Get a non vaild triangle error</p>
