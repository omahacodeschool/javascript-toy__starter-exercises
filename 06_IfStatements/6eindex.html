  <h2>Does it matter what order your `if` / `else if` statements happen?</h2>
  
- What's wrong with this conditional: `if (age < 16 && age > 21)`?
- Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your `if` statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?
