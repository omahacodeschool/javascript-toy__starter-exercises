  The only statement that I guessed incorrectly was "true == 'true' is " + (true == 'true')". I guessed that this would be true, but it is in fact, false. The reason I got it wrong, is because I took a guess on that one. I had a funny feeling (which I shouldn't have trusted) that JavaScript would somehow consider 'true' to be truthy, or loosely true... or something.

<h2>What do you call `true` and `false` values?</h2>
<p>Booleans</p>
<h2> How is `true` similar or dissimilar from `"true"`? Can they be used in the same way?</h2>
<p>"True (without quotes) and "true" are two completely different things in the world of JavaScript. Using the word "true" inside of quotes makes it merely a string (which would technically have a value of false, according to my google searches. Something to do with the fact that it cannot be converted to a number). Using 'true' without quotes is the correct way use true, if a boolean is what you want.</p>
