  <h1>JS Atomic 06 F</h1>

  <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h2>
  <p>I attempted to input a letter and the evaluation returned the alert for it not being a valid triangle.</p>

  <h2>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h2>
  <p>From 1 to 3 inputs of 0, the evaluation returned the alert for it not being a valid trianlge.</p>

  <h2>What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h2>
  <p>The result was the same as for the previous two.</p>
