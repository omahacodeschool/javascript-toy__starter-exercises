  <h1>Questions:</h1>
<p>
- Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?
</p>
<p>
No, the script will hit on all statements that return true. 
</p>
<p>
- When testing ranges, did you use `&&`, `||`, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used `&&`, why is that a better choice than `||` (and vice-versa)?
</p>
<p>
I used `&&` to test ranges. Using `||` would not work how I need them to, because `||` would have taken the first `true` statement. Because the range has a bottom-half (>0), I need BOTH to be `true`.

</p>
<p>
- What types of input produce a value of `NaN` after parsing? Is it important to check for `NaN` values? Is it possible for a `NaN` value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?
</p>
<p>
Letter, or non-number characters produce a NaN value. It is important to check, because, though the program won't fail, none of the alerts will be triggered.
