  <h2>
    Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?
  </h2>
  <p>
    I was pretty sure of the answer, but I just tried it out anyway. Turns out, as I assumed, that there isnt' any flexibility when it comes to capitalization (at least with the code as it is right now. Usint toLowerCase for the user input would definitely change all of this, for instance).
  </p>
  <h2>
    Did you use `=` or `==` or `===` to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?
  </h2>
  <p>
    I used "==" because we're looking for basic equality in this situation. We're not necessarily checking the "type" of the user's input. That said, using "===" would work in this case (I double-checked to make sure) because the input from the user is being converted into a string and the variable we are setting is also a string; they are the same types of objects.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?
  </h2>
  <p>
    I think the main reason this would be a bad idea, is because this is all happening in the web browser. Meaning, anyone can look at the source code and figure out the password if they know where to look. Also, things would become very complicated very quickly if we had more than one password and more than one user.
