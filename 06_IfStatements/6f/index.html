  <h1>JS Atomic 06f - Triangles</h1>
  <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h2>
  <p>No math can be done on NaN so the "sad triangle" message dispays. I guess I could write a condtitional to check for NaN.</p>
  <h2>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h2>
  <p>Thats a sad triangle. Triangles can't have 2 sides. </p>
  <h2>What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h2>
  <p>Looks like a wrote some pretty solid triangle checking code. Negative values make for sad triangles.</p>
