  <h1>Questions:</h1>
<p>
- What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as `NaN`?
</p>
The program assigns numbers to the characters on the keyboard. I can make theoretically possible triangles with just letters.
<p>
- What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is `0`? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?
</p>
As it is now, my program makes a simple calculation. as long as 0 + another side > the last side, it declares the triangle possible.
<p>
- What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?
</p>
Same as above. If the math works, it works fine.
<p>
Assuming errors exist, note that all of these errors come from the user inputting one or more invalid values. What are some strategies you might use to prevent this from happening (or at least to prevent those invalid values from being used)?
</p>
Input Validation!
