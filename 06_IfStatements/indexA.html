  <h1>JS Atomic 06-A</h1>

  <h2>What do you call true and false values?</h2>
  <p>Booleans.</p>

  <h2>How is true similar or dissimilar from "true"? Can they be used in the same way?</h2>
  <p>The boolean true is part of a true/false (yes/no) pair, and "true" is just a string of the word true. They are <i>not</i> interchangable.</p>

<p>5 == '5' = true</p>
<p>5 == 'five' = false</p>
<p>5 == '6' = false</p>
<p>5 === '5' = false</p>
<p>5 == 2 + 3 = true</p>
<p>5 == 5 = true</p>
<p>5 === 5 = true</p>
<p>true == 'true' = true -- <i>I GOT THIS ONE WRONG. I thought the == (as opposed to ===) would make them equal, but on second thought, it's not going to turn a Boolean into a string. Duh.</i></p>
true === 'true' = false</p>
<p>true == false = false</p>
<p>5 == 12 = false</p>
<p>5 != 12 = true</p>
<p>5 < 12 = true</p>
<p>5 <= 12 = true</p>
<p>5 > 12 = false</p>
<p>5 >= 12 = false</p>
