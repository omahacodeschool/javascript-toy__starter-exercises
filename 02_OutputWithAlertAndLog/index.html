  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>From what I understand, alert() is used to send a message to the user. It is usually more literall and the developer has more controll over the message. console.log() is a tool used by developers to store information about the html view. The console log can be viewed using a browsers built in javascript log. </p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>One possible function is to use them to show confirmation messages before a user does some potentially damaging action such as deleting an account.</p>
  <p>Maybe you'll have a couple paragraphs for an answer?</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>Alerts appear to jump out each time that a view is loaded, and it looks like the halt the flow of the website. This can be useful, but it also look like alerts could get very obnoxious if they aren't placed correctly, or if they are used too much. They should also not be used for debugging, thats what console.log is for. </p>
