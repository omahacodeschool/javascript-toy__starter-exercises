  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>Alert creates a pop up. Console.log prints to the browser console.</p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>If they're going to delete something sensitive./p>
  <p>Maybe you'll have a couple paragraphs for an answer?</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>If it happened during a frequent user action like changing views on a web app.</p>
