  <h1>JS Atomic 02</h1>
  
  
  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>An alert opens a 'popup window' to give a message to the user, the console.log() provides an output on the console.</p>
  
  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>Possible greetings, to give important information, or specifically notify the user in a more direct way than just printing the information on the screen.</p>
  
  
  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>Over use of altert()s could deffinately get annoying, and really I think should be saved for times when it could be important or particularly relevant.</p>

  <h2>Would it make sense to use `console.log()` to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
  <p>The console.log() is really more to see what the computer is doing as a method to track that.  Seeing as though only the end user is privvy to this information, it doesnt make it a primary means for displaying information to the user.</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `console.log()` might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
  <p>I can see myself tracking what java is doing.</p>

  <h2>When do the `console.log()` statements get run? Is it before the first `alert()` gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
  <p>console.log statements get run after the first alert, before the last, and before the page's information is retrieved. </p>
