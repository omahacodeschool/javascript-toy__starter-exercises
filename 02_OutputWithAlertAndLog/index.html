      The difference between 'alert()' and 'console.log' is 'alert()' puts a string, whereas 'console.log' allows you to inspect the object itself (according to the internet, anyway). Also, 'alert()' halts everything, until it is dismissed, while 'console.log' does not.

    Some situations where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something could be in the event of deleting something like a profile, or alerting the user that she has been logged out.

      Would it make sense to use `console.log()` to tell the user things? Why or why not? 
      No, it doesn't appear so. That info isn't visible (at least not in this state) unless one opens the js console in the browser.

      What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?
      One way in which it is already obnoxious: "Are you sure you want to leave this page?". It demands your attention by arresting your browser until it is addressed.

      What's one way that `console.log()` might be a good tool for you to use?
      For debugging, I imagine? One could use it to track user interaction with the page, I think...

      When do the `console.log()` statements get run? Is it before the first `alert()` gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?
      The console.log statements are run just after the first alert is clicked. I stepped through the flow in the Source tab on the js console in Chrome.
