  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>alert() generates a popup window containing a set message. The user sees ths and is forced to interact with it. 
  console.log() is a nifty tool that allows devs to see data set in console.log() methods.
   You can get to a page's console by right clicking the page and selecting "inspect." 
  On Macs, you can also get there by the shortcut command "cmd + option + j" 
  It is invaluable when attempting to get analytics or test certain points of functionality.</p>
  
  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>It might be useful to do an alert for instructions on how to do something on the page, an alert when something has been added/saved,
  or if the user has done something that will perhaps prevent them form moving forward through a process
   (such as not filling out a specific form on a sign up page and then trying to click submit (I dunno if i like this one, though)</p>
  
  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>Just about anything that isn't an error, to be honest. 
  Extra clicks are bad. And they seem like they would effictive tools for error alerts.
   But people will get desensitized to them if your site is overly saturated with alerts.</p>
