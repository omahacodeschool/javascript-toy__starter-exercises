  <h1>JS Atomic 02</h1>
  
  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>An alert() is a public message with a pop-up, a console.log() is a message that one has to access the console to view. An alert() is forced upon you, whereas a console.log() has to be sought out.</p>
  
  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>Well, if the name is a good indication, you should use it as an ALERT--it makes sure that the user acknowledges the warning or message before they can go forward in any way. </p>
  <p>So, using some of our previous projects as examples, I could have used an alert() to let the admins of the swimming competition know that events were locked, or remind them before they even view the "delete swimmer" page that deleting a swimmer removes them from events, things like that.</p>
  
  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>WELL, too many of them and you might make the user think they went to a spam page. They should be used only when information NEEDS to be brought front and center and even then, used sparingly. There is a flow to web browsing and disrupting that flow <b>too much</b> could make people avoid your work entirely.</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `console.log()` might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
  <p>I'm excited by the debugging possiblities--hiding 'console.log()' messages to tell me if emails have been triggered or whathaveyou. I mean, you could even use it almost like binding.pry, having the console tell you how variables and info are changing AS THEY CHANGE (this might be overgeneralizing or abusing this function)</p>

  <h2>When do the `console.log()` statements get run?</h2>
  <p>My 'console.log' statements ran after "OK" on the first 'alert()' was displayed, I think since the website itself doesn't reload until the "OK" is hit on that alert box.</p>

  <h2>Questions:</h2>
   <p>Since all this is new, I'm not sure of all the functionality (and limitations) of alert(). Can events be triggered by the "OK" button? Or does "OK" just function as a way to acknowledge the window has been closed? If I wanted an elaborate, specific error message, I imagine that I could figure out a way to customize that, the way we did with Ruby, and I think that would make it more useful.</p>
