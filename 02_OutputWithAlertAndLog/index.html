  <h1>JS Atomic 02</h1>

  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>Alert creates a pop-up with text for the user. Console.log is like a puts statement in Ruby.</p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>Alert might be useful in the way we've been using error pages in the past--like to tell a user "You entered a blank field for your password" or something of the sort.</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>Alerts could get obnoxious fast--I feel like they're best suited to telling the user that something isn't the way it should be (eg. error messages)--because alerts require the user to move the cursor to such a weird part of the screen to exit out of the alert, having to do so often could really get annoying.</p>
