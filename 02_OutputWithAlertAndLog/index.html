  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>
    The `alert()` function creates a pop up for the user whereas the `console.log()` creates a line of text in the console, much like the puts command in ruby. 
  </p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>
    A good situation to use the `alert()` command would be to warn the user when they are creating a permanent change to a database such as deleting.
  </p>
  

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>
    The `alert()` might get obnoxious if you have multiple `alert()` commands.  
  </p>
