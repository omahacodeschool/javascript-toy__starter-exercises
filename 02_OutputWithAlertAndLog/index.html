  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>alert("Whoa there Grizzly Bear") pops up, then the page's HTML loads.  From W3C -- The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button.  An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.</p>
