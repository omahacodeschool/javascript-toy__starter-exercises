  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p> Alert converts the object passed to it into a string. Cconsole.log() is not limited to displaying a simple string and can allow you to interact with the object passed to it.</p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>Use it as a warning, like when they're about to delete their user account</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>If you're debugging something you'll have to keep closing the alert window</p>

  <h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
  <p> i don't know </p>

  <h2>What's one way that console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
  <p> When you want to access the obejct inside of it. </p>

  <h2>When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
  <p> I don't know </p>

  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
