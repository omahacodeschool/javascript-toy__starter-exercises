  <h1>JS Atomic 02</h1>
  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>Alert pops up an alert box in front of the screen which you have to click "OK" to make go away. Console.log, I've read more than once, is "just like puts" in Ruby. I don't think this is the case. To my knowledge, "puts" doesn't put anything in a special log that's invisible to users.</p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>If someone's time-limited login session was about to expire due to inactivity on the page.</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>It's obnoxious because you can't do anything else on the page until you click OK and make it go away.</p>
