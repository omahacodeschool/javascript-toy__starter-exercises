  <h3>1. Why don't you need to use the `var` keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does `var` do?</h3>
  <p> You don't need to use the 'var' keyword everytime because it's just initializing the variable for use later on. It's defining the variable like 'name' for example.</p>

  <h3>2. What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error mess
  </h3>
  <p>
  If you try to do that you get an error in the console about an unchaught reference variable. The program will still run up to that point.
