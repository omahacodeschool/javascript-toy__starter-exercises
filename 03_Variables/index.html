  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
<h3>1. Why don't you need to use the `var` keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does `var` do?</h2>
<p>You don't need to use 'var' every time you use a variable because you only do so when creating a variable. 
Unlike Ruby, which seems to know that the thing to the left of the equal sign is a variable, in javascript, 'var' is the equivalent of going
"Okay computer, tell my program that we're going to make a variable now." After the initial creation, the program knows that the collection of characters you used is now a variable.
and calling 'var' again would be overkill.</p>

<h3>2. What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h3>
<p>If you attempt to output a variable like 'var test;' and then call it in an alert, it will return a value of 'undefined' when called. For me, the program still seemed to run as intended. I didn't get any error messages in console, either.
However, I wasn't trying to force that variable to interact with another variable (like a + b), which I am sure would lead to some issues. </p>

<h3>3. What questions do you have?</h3>
<p> I was looking into how to get variables to nest in strings like we did in Ruby. ( "I AN EXAMPLE #{VAR}" )
I looked to the internet. The general response was that it previously wasn't possible in older browsers. However, people were saying that it now should be possible
when using formats like 'THIS IS ANOTHER ${example}'.
...But it  still didn't seem to work for me. I then tried looking into if the functionality just didn't work with alerts or even stringONstring business, but wasn't able to find anything absolutely concrete on the topic.</p>


<p>Okay. I lied. I found the answer. I was using ' not `. </p>
