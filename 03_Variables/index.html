  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>

	<h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
	<p>Because once it's created using var, the object type is assigned. It's like when you create a Hash in ruby. You only need to assign the type when you're creating it. Var holds values.</p>

	<h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
	<p> It would return 'undefined'. The JS won't run if it's undefined.</p>

	<h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
	<p> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>
