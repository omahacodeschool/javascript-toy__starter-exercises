  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
  <h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
  <p>The var keyword is used to set a variable.</p>
  <br>

  <h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable?  Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
  <p>In the javascript console we get the following message 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token var'</p>
  <br>

  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>No questions</p>
