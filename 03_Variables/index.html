  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
  <h2>
    Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does <code>var</code> do?
  </h2>

  <p>
    The <code>var</code> keyword initializes a variable and lets the editor know that the word that follows is a variable. This is what allows us to use that word later.
  </p>

  <h2>
    What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?
  </h2>

  <p>
    The program will still run, however, when it reaches the point where the unassigned variable is used an error will be placed in the console. The error message is <code>Uncaught ReferenceError: favoriteFood is not defined</code>.
