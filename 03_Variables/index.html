  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
<p>
1. Why don't you need to use the `var` keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does `var` do?
</p>
<p>
JS just works this way, I suppose. It is the syntax to declare a variable, at which point it exists as an empty variable. The assignment of a value does not need 'var', though you can declare and assign a value in one step.
</p>
<p>
2. What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?
</p>
<p>
If the variable is yet undefined, the alert doesn't happen, and the next alert doesn't either. I get "Uncaught ReferenceError: `variable name` is not defined" message in the JS console.
</p>
<p>
3. What questions do you have?
</p>
<p>
I think I have many, but will reserve them for the end, or for next lecture, and just learn in the meantime. :)
