  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
  <h2>Why don't you need to use the `var` keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does `var` do?</h2>
  <p>'Var' lets javascript know that YOU know you haven't established this variable before. If I wanted to add a year to my age further along in the code, I could say "age = age +1" but the FIRST time, you need 'var'</p>
  <h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable?</h2>
  <p>If I've never assigned the variable at all, the console.log displays "Uncaught ReferenceError: age is not defined"</p>
  <p>CONFUSINGLY ENOUGH, if I don't use 'var' first...it still assigns the variable? Isn't...isn't that not supposed to work?</p>
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>I thought var a = thing was a hard rule for Javascript, but it doesn't seem to change anything if I have it or not...is this something weird happening on my part, or is there another reason for using 'var' that I'm missing?</p>
