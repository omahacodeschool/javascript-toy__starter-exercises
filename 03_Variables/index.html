  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
  <h3>1. Why don't you need to use the `var` keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does `var` do?</h3>
  <p>The use of 'var' in javascript allows us to set a variable initially.  the prefix isnt needed when referencing the variable after that because it has already been set as a variable.</p>
<h3>2. What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h3>
<p>Without defining a variable, it can not be used as intended.  If a variable is not defined, when trying to reference it an error, 'uncaught reference error' occurs in the console.</p>
<h3>3. What questions do you have?</h3>
<p>None at this time.</p>
