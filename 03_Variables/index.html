  <h1>JS Atomic 03</h1>
  <!-- Answer the 3 questions above here -->
  <h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
  <p>My best guess as to why we only need to use var when creating the variable is so that JS knows exactly what type of object we are creating. Later, when we refer to that object, JS already knows what it is.</p>

  <h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
  <p>When I removed the definition of the hair_color variable, that alert didn't appear in the user interface, and I got an error that "hair_color is not defined" in the console..</p>

  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>I tried to remove the word 'var' from right before I defined a variable for the first time, and it seemed to work both when I called that variable in the console and also in an alert. I'd like to know why--and also, why it's necessary to use 'var' if the code actually works without it.</p>
