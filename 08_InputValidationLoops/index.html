  <h1>JS Atomic 08</h1>
    <h2> ## 8A: What's the Password? </h2>
      <h3>What does this program look like if done with a `while` loop? With a `for` loop? Which is better?</h3>
        <p> If the program uses a while loop, the while loop should continue while the password does not match the user input. 
        In this case, I think that the while loop is a better method to use because I was trying to coompare the entirely of the string's contents to another, rather than each element in the string.</p>

      <h3>Did you use `==` or `===`? Does it matter? </h3>
        <p> I actually used != in the while loop, unlike what I did in the previous assignment because I wanted the loop and prompt to continue as long as the input didn't match the password. 
        I still think == is better, on the off chance the password isn't a string (i.e. set of integers)</p>
