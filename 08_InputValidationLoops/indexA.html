  <h1>JS Atomic 08A</h1>

  <h2>What does this program look like if done with a while loop? With a for loop? Which is better?</h2>
  <p>My current program is running with a while loop. I don't know how it would function with a for loop because there's no iterator or number changing with each loop--this actually confuses the hell out of me.</p>
  
  <h2>Did you use == or ===? Does it matter?</h2>
  <p>I used ==. I assume that === would work as well.</p>
