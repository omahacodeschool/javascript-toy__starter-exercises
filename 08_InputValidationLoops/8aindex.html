<h2>What does this program look like if done with a `while` loop? With a `for` loop? Which is better?<br>
Did you use `==` or `===`? Does it matter?</h2>
<p>I decided the while loop was more appropriate here, since there was really only one condition that needed to be met to continue the loop.</p>
<p>I used !== (which is to === as != is to ==). If you wrote something with equals instead of DOES NOT equal, you'd want ===, to make it as exact as possible.</p>
